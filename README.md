## How to run a C program

One of the best GUI for C and other programming languages is EMACS.
So after installing EMACS to run a programm, you have to access EMACS' terminal, eshell.

### On Linux Machines:
ALT-X eshell
sudo apt-get install gcc
"sudo password"
gcc -o executable_name file_name.c 
./ executable_name
______________________________________

The executable is the actual file that will be runned and output the programm
if there's a math.h library on you program that you have to run it like:
gcc -o executable_name file_name.c -lm
